      "    - segmenting the grid into zones or partitions, which can be treated as sub-grids\n",

      "* **Object persistence**:\n",
      "  + Objects are assumed to persist despite the presence of noise or occlusion by other objects\n",
      "    - For example, if a square is partially covered by a triangle, the solver should still recognize the underlying square\n",

      "* **Object influence via contact**: \n",
      "  + Many problems feature physical contact between objects\n",
      "    - For instance: one object being translated until it is in contact with another\n",

      "* **Basic Geometry and Topology priors**:\n",
      "  + Geometric and topological reasoning is crucial. Commonly encountered concepts include:\n",
      "    - Shapes: Lines, rectangles and simple shapes;  Other objects that occur are likely to have simple motifs\n",
      "    - Transformations: rotation, translation, mirroring, flipping, scaling (overall or horizontal/vertical)\n",
      "    - Relationships: Containing/contained, inside/outside perimeter, corners, parallel lines, topological connectedness, set relationships (inclusion, intersection, disjointness).\n",
      "    - Actions: Drawing lines, connecting points, orthogonal projections, copying, repeating objects\n",
      "    - Self-similarity via symmetries such as rotations and mirroring\n",

      "  + Many ARC problems involve counting or sorting objects and/or comparing numbers, for instance:\n",
      "    - Which shape or symbol appears most / least / same number of times?\n",
      "    - Which object is the largest / smallest?\n",
      "    - Which objects are the same size / color?\n",
      "  + Similarly actions being taken might depend on counting and/or comparing numbers\n",

      "* **Goal-directedness prior**:\n",
